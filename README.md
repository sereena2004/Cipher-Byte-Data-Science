**Data Science Projects**
This repository contains two Data Science projects:

**1. Iris Flower Classification**
Project Description:
Classify Iris flowers into their respective species (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica) based on their measurements.
Dataset:
Provided by Scikit-learn library
Also available for download 
Task:
Train a machine learning model to learn from the measurements of the Iris species and classify them accurately.

**2. Spam Email Detection with Machine Learning**
Project Description:
Build an email spam detector using Python and machine learning algorithms to classify emails into spam and non-spam categories.
Task:
Develop a Python-based email spam detector
Train the spam detector using machine learning algorithms to recognize and classify emails into spam and non-spam
